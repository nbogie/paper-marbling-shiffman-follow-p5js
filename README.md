# p5js-example
While we recommend you use [OpenProcessing](https://openprocessing.org/) (or the [p5.js web editor](https://editor.p5js.org/)) to play with p5.js most of the time, this example project is useful if you want to develop locally using (for example) vscode, and also shows you a slightly bigger picture.

It's an example index.html, and p5.js "sketch" file.


# installation / running:
1. open the project in vscode
2. [Install the Live Server vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
3. right click on index.html
4. choose "open with live server" (or similar)
5. this should automatically launch your browser to view the html file which in turn will load the mySketch.js and the p5.js library.
6. edit mySketch.js and save the changes - you should immediately be able to observe the changes in the browser.
7. look for errors in the browser js console
8. have fun coding!

Please note we DO NOT use Live Server at all for React development!
